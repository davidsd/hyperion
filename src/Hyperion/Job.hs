-- * General comments
-- $
-- In this module we define the 'Job' monad. It is nothing more than 'Process'
-- together with 'JobEnv' environment.
--
-- The 'JobEnv' environment represents the environment of a job running under
-- @SLURM@. We should think about a computation in 'Job' as being run on a
-- node allocated for the job by @SLURM@ and running remote computations on the
-- resources allocated to the job. The 'JobEnv' environment
-- contains
--
--     * information about the master program that scheduled the job,
--     * information about the database used for recording results of the calculations,
--     * number of CPUs available per node, as well as the number of CPUs to
--       use for remote computations spawned from the 'Job' computation ('jobTaskCpus'),
--     * 'jobTaskLauncher', which allocates 'jobTaskCpus' CPUs on some node from
--       the resources available to the job and launches a worker on that node.
--       That worker is then allowed to use the allocated number of CPUs.
--       Thanks to 'jobTaskLauncher', 'Job' is an instance of 'Hyperion.Remote.HasWorkers' and
--       we can use functions such as 'Hyperion.Remote.remoteEval'.
--
-- The common usecase is that the 'Job' computation is spawned from a 'Cluster'
-- calculation on login node via, e.g., 'remoteEvalJob' (which acquires job
-- resources from @SLURM@). The 'Job' computation then manages the job resources
-- and runs remote computations in the allocation via, e.g., 'Hyperion.Remote.remoteEval'.

-- | Given a `NodeLauncherConfig` and a 'WorkerAddr' runs the continuation
-- 'Maybe' passing it a pair @('WorkerAddr', 'WorkerLauncher'
-- 'JobId')@.  Passing 'Nothing' repersents a remote tool failure.
--
-- While 'WorkerAddr' is preserved, the passed 'WorkerLauncher'
-- launches workers on the node at 'WorkerAddr'. The launcher is
-- derived from 'workerLauncherWithRunCmd', where command runner is
-- either local shell (if 'WorkerAddr' is 'LocalHost') or a
-- 'RemoteFunction' that runs the local shell on 'WorkerAddr' via
-- 'withRemoteRunProcess' and related functions (if 'WorkerAddr' is
-- 'RemoteAddr').
--
-- Note that the process of launching a worker on the remote node will
-- actually spawn an \"utility\" worker there that will launch all new
-- workers in the continuation.  This utility worker will have its log
-- in the log dir, identified by some random 'ServiceId' and put
-- messages like \"Running command ...\".
--
-- The reason that utility workers are used on each Job node is to
-- minimize the number of calls to the remote tool (@ssh@ or @srun@). The naive way to
-- launch workers in the 'Job' monad would be to determine what node
-- they should be run on, and run the hyperion worker command via
-- @ssh@. Unfortunately, many clusters have flakey @ssh@
-- configurations that start throwing errors if @ssh@ is called too
-- many times in quick succession. @ssh@ also has to perform
-- authentication. Experience shows that @srun@ is also not a good
-- solution to this problem, since @srun@ talks to @SLURM@ to manage
-- resources and this can take a long time, affecting
-- performance. Instead, we the remote tool exactly once to each node in the Job
-- (besides the head node), and start utility workers there. These
-- workers can then communicate with the head node via the usual
-- machinery of @hyperion@ --- effectively, we keep a connection open
-- to each node so that we no longer have to use the remote tool.
