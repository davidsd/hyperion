-- | We can define a polymorphic function that calls 'sayHello'
-- remotely. However, it has 'Static (...)' constraints that must be
-- satisfied by the caller. Note that 'Static (Binary String)' is
-- provided in 'Hyperion.Static', which is why it doesn't appear here.

-- | Here's an example of providing the 'Static' instances
data Bar = MkBar
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Generic, Binary)

-- | The instances are trivial since GHC can supply the 'Show Bar'
-- constraint automatically. But because of the 'static' keyword, we
-- must still write them. This could in principle be automated with
-- TemplateHaskell, as in
-- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/static-closure-0.1.0.0/docs/Control-Static-Closure-TH.html
--
-- With these instances we can use 'sayHelloRemote' with Bar.

-- | Optionally, using withClosureDict, we can also supply 'Static'
-- instances "on the fly".

sayHelloRemoteFoo =
  withClosureDict @(Show Foo) (static Dict) $

-- | In the above example, we had to define a bunch of 'Static'
-- instances whenever we wanted to use a new type. However, sometimes
-- we can generate them automatically. An example is 'KnownNat
-- j'. There is a magical instance 'KnownNat j => Static (KnownNat j)'
-- in 'Hyperion.Closure'. This allows us to define other 'Statics'
-- that build off of it.
